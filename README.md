# PUGchamp

A Discord bot for managing Overwatch pickup games (PUGs, hence the name) on a server a friend of mine runs. Uses JDA for interaction with Discord servers. Token obviously removed from public repo, I'm not that stupid.

Want to join the server? https://discord.gg/ZvV6VCy

Haha who am I kidding, the only reason you're here is because you followed the link I posted in the bot updates channel out of curiosity. Ta-daa! hope you know Java, because I sure didn't have the patience to comment this what with it being a personal project and all.

(Prospective employers who may be reading, do note that this is not going to be my practice if I end up working for you)
